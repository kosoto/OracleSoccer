# Name: RMANDBHotBackupIncr0.rcv
#
# Description:
# Hot Backup of Database Incremental Level 0 (same as full backup)
# Defaults used from Controlfile (see RMANSetup.rcv)
# Optional backup to tape - please remove comment CONFIGURE DEFAULT DEVICE TYPE sbt
#
# Note: To avoid known issues, RMAN client should be the same version as server.
#       The easiest way to avoid client/server mismatches is run the script on the server.
#
# The archivelogs will be backed up twice
# Archives older than three days will be removed
#
# Variables:
# USER               : Username with SYSDBA Privilegue (AS SYSDBA is implied)
# PWD                : Password (encrypted)
# DB                 : Database-Connection
# RMAN_LOG_LOCATION  : Destination directory for script output
